# Ada Exception Handling and Division by Zero

This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: division by zero.  The code includes a conditional check to prevent the division by zero, but also shows how exceptions can be handled using the `exception` block to prevent program crashes.  The solution improves error handling and clarifies potential issues.

## How to Run

To compile and run this code, you'll need an Ada compiler (like GNAT).  The files `bug.ada` and `bugSolution.ada` contain the buggy and corrected code respectively.
